# Imputation-Methods-using-Tree-Models-Simulation-in-R

A comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the robustness of logistic regression and
random forest models when missing values are present. Different levels of missing values are simulated,
along with different imputation methods, including mode imputation and random forest imputation. The
variables of interest are strictly categorical. The performance of the two models in this context is evaluated
primarily using the misclassification rate, as well as the AUC (area under the curve), precision, specificity,
and sensitivity.
